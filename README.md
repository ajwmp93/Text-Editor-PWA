# Text Editor PWA

## Description
I wanted to make this PWA so that I could make notes or add code snippets without needing to be on a dedicated internet connection. This will allow me to be able to easily edit text and code without needing to be on an internet connection if I am on a laptop or tablet device. This project taught me the importance of understanding where the names of the databases and other items were coming from, it took me a minute to figure out where that information was listed within the code itself.

## Credits
I was aided in coding this by our previous homework assignments as well as some small help from ChatGPT
